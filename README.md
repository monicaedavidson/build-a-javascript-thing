Build a Javascript Thing Assignment
JSON, Ajax, jQuery fade and more JavaScript were added to the previous assignment.
Collaborators were Sheyna, Casey and Monica
This assignment builds upon Casey and Henok's previous assignment. It is coded so that the user can enter any number and it will randomly generate Henok's favorite, most loved albums. A jQuery fade was implemented to make the website extra beautiful. Also, JavaScript code was inserted that tracks the time of the day. The files were altered to use JSON and Ajax.
